\section{Stokes flow in zebrafish}

Since the 1960s, the zebrafish has become increasingly important to scientific research. It has many characteristics that make it a valuable model for studying human genetics and disease. It was the first vertebrate to be cloned and is particularly notable for its regenerative abilities. Zebrafish have a similar genetic structure to humans. They share 70 per cent of genes with us and they are cheaper to maintain than mice. The zebrafish adult is about 2.5 cm to 4 cm long. 

To study the effect of different drugs being able to model the blood flow is important. For instance, if the drug actually never reaches the infected cells a potentially effective drug might be considered ineffective on wrong the wrong basis. 

The blood velocities in a zebrafish are low thus using \emph{Stokes flow} as a model is a fair approximation.

\section{Squeezing a postdoc's brain}

We would very much like to squeeze postdoc Erika Lindström's brain. Since she has refused to let us do this with our hands in her office, we must do this on a computer using her brain as our computational domain. The brain will be deformed as a result of the squeezing and to capture this effect we will use a \emph{linear elastic} model. 

A mesh of Erika's brain can be found in the git repository:
 https://github.com/krikarls/fun-with-fem.

\end{figure}

The brain is not clamped in the skull, but in a sence floating around. This means that we must employ \emph{neumann booundary conditions} on the entire boundary. As we know, there are no unique solution to such a problem since all \emph{rigid motions} satify the equation. So in order to obtain a unique solution we must remove all rigid motions. All the possible rigid motions in 3D are: translations in $x,y,z$-direction and rotations around the corresponding axes. Thus six in total.

An example using \emph{FEniCS} on how to remove these can be found in the same repository as the brain.
